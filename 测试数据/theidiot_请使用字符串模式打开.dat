We were driving along the road from Treguier to Kervanda 
We passed at a smart trot between the hedges topping an earth wall on each side of the road 
then at the foot of the steep ascent before Ploumar the horse dropped into a walk  and the driver jumped down heavily from the box 
He flicked his whip and climbed the incline  stepping clumsily uphill by the side of the carriage  one hand on the footboard  his eyes on the ground 
After a while he lifted his head  pointed up the road with the end of the whip  and said 
 
The idiot 
 The sun was shining violently upon the undulating surface of the land 
The rises were topped by clumps of meagre trees  with their branches showing high on the sky as if they had been perched upon stilts 
The small fields  cut up by hedges and stone walls that zig zagged over the slopes  lay in rectangular patches of vivid greens and yellows  resembling the unskilful daubs of a naive picture 
And the landscape was divided in two by the white streak of a road stretching in long loops far away  like a river of dust crawling out of the hills on its way to the sea 
 Here he is  
said the driver  again 
In the long grass bordering the road a face glided past the carriage at the level of the wheels as we drove slowly by 
The imbecile face was red  and the bullet head with close cropped hair seemed to lie alone  its chin in the dust 
The body was lost in the bushes growing thick along the bottom of the deep ditch 
It was a boy s face 
He might have been sixteen  judging from the size 
perhaps less  perhaps more 
Such creatures are forgotten by time  and live untouched by years till death gathers them up into its compassionate bosom 
the faithful death that never forgets in the press of work the most insignificant of its children 
 Ah 
there s another  
said the man  with a certain satisfaction in his tone  as if he had caught sight of something expected 
There was another 
That one stood nearly in the middle of the road in the blaze of sunshine at the end of his own short shadow 
And he stood with hands pushed into the opposite sleeves of his long coat  his head sunk between the shoulders  all hunched up in the flood of heat 
From a distance he had the aspect of one suffering from intense cold 
 Those are twins  
explained the driver 
The idiot shuffled two paces out of the way and looked at us over his shoulder when we brushed past him 
The glance was unseeing and staring  a fascinated glance 
but he did not turn to look after us 
Probably the image passed before the eyes without leaving any trace on the misshapen brain of the creature 
When we had topped the ascent I looked over the hood 
He stood in the road just where we had left him 
The driver clambered into his seat  clicked his tongue  and we went downhill 
The brake squeaked horribly from time to time 
At the foot he eased off the noisy mechanism and said  turning half round on his box 
 
We shall see some more of them by and by 
 
More idiots 
How many of them are there  then 
 I asked 
 There s four of them 
children of a farmer near Ploumar here 
 
 
 
The parents are dead now  
he added  after a while 
 The grandmother lives on the farm 
In the daytime they knock about on this road  and they come home at dusk along with the cattle 
 
 
 
It s a good farm 
 We saw the other two 
a boy and a girl  as the driver said 
They were dressed exactly alike  in shapeless garments with petticoat like skirts 
The imperfect thing that lived within them moved those beings to howl at us from the top of the bank  where they sprawled amongst the tough stalks of furze 
Their cropped black heads stuck out from the bright yellow wall of countless small blossoms 
The faces were purple with the strain of yelling 
the voices sounded blank and cracked like a mechanical imitation of old people s voices 
and suddenly ceased when we turned into a lane 
I saw them many times in my wandering about the country 
They lived on that road  drifting along its length here and there  according to the inexplicable impulses of their monstrous darkness 
They were an offence to the sunshine  a reproach to empty heaven  a blight on the concentrated and purposeful vigour of the wild landscape 
In time the story of their parents shaped itself before me out of the listless answers to my questions  out of the indifferent words heard in wayside inns or on the very road those idiots haunted 
Some of it was told by an emaciated and sceptical old fellow with a tremendous whip  while we trudged together over the sands by the side of a two wheeled cart loaded with dripping seaweed 
Then at other times other people confirmed and completed the story 
till it stood at last before me  a tale formidable and simple  as they always are  those disclosures of obscure trials endured by ignorant hearts 
When he returned from his military service Jean Pierre Bacadou found the old people very much aged 
He remarked with pain that the work of the farm was not satisfactorily done 
The father had not the energy of old days 
The hands did not feel over them the eye of the master 
Jean Pierre noted with sorrow that the heap of manure in the courtyard before the only entrance to the house was not so large as it should have been 
The fences were out of repair  and the cattle suffered from neglect 
At home the mother was practically bedridden  and the girls chattered loudly in the big kitchen  unrebuked  from morning to night 
He said to himself 
 We must change all this 
 He talked the matter over with his father one evening when the rays of the setting sun entering the yard between the outhouses ruled the heavy shadows with luminous streaks 
Over the manure heap floated a mist  opal tinted and odorous  and the marauding hens would stop in their scratching to examine with a sudden glance of their round eye the two men  both lean and tall  talking in hoarse tones 
The old man  all twisted with rheumatism and bowed with years of work  the younger bony and straight  spoke without gestures in the indifferent manner of peasants  grave and slow 
But before the sun had set the father had submitted to the sensible arguments of the son 
 It is not for me that I am speaking  
insisted Jean Pierre 
 It is for the land 
It s a pity to see it badly used 
I am not impatient for myself 
 The old fellow nodded over his stick 
 I dare say 
I dare say  
he muttered 
 You may be right 
Do what you like 
It s the mother that will be pleased 
 The mother was pleased with her daughter in law 
Jean Pierre brought the two wheeled spring cart with a rush into the yard 
The gray horse galloped clumsily  and the bride and bridegroom  sitting side by side  were jerked backwards and forwards by the up and down motion of the shafts  in a manner regular and brusque 
On the road the distanced wedding guests straggled in pairs and groups 
The men advanced with heavy steps  swinging their idle arms 
They were clad in town clothes 
jackets cut with clumsy smartness  hard black hats  immense boots  polished highly 
Their women all in simple black  with white caps and shawls of faded tints folded triangularly on the back  strolled lightly by their side 
In front the violin sang a strident tune  and the biniou snored and hummed  while the player capered solemnly  lifting high his heavy clogs 
The sombre procession drifted in and out of the narrow lanes  through sunshine and through shade  between fields and hedgerows  scaring the little birds that darted away in troops right and left 
In the yard of Bacadou s farm the dark ribbon wound itself up into a mass of men and women pushing at the door with cries and greetings 
The wedding dinner was remembered for months 
It was a splendid feast in the orchard 
Farmers of considerable means and excellent repute were to be found sleeping in ditches  all along the road to Treguier  even as late as the afternoon of the next day 
All the countryside participated in the happiness of Jean Pierre 
He remained sober  and  together with his quiet wife  kept out of the way  letting father and mother reap their due of honour and thanks 
But the next day he took hold strongly  and the old folks felt a shadow 
precursor of the grave 
fall upon them finally 
The world is to the young 
When the twins were born there was plenty of room in the house  for the mother of Jean Pierre had gone away to dwell under a heavy stone in the cemetery of Ploumar 
On that day  for the first time since his son s marriage  the elder Bacadou  neglected by the cackling lot of strange women who thronged the kitchen  left in the morning his seat under the mantel of the fireplace  and went into the empty cow house  shaking his white locks dismally 
Grandsons were all very well  but he wanted his soup at midday 
When shown the babies  he stared at them with a fixed gaze  and muttered something like 
 It s too much 
 Whether he meant too much happiness  or simply commented upon the number of his descendants  it is impossible to say 
He looked offended 
 as far as his old wooden face could express anything 
and for days afterwards could be seen  almost any time of the day  sitting at the gate  with his nose over his knees  a pipe between his gums  and gathered up into a kind of raging concentrated sulkiness 
Once he spoke to his son  alluding to the newcomers with a groan 
 They will quarrel over the land 
 
Don t bother about that  father  
answered Jean Pierre  stolidly  and passed  bent double  towing a recalcitrant cow over his shoulder 
He was happy  and so was Susan  his wife 
It was not an ethereal joy welcoming new souls to struggle  perchance to victory 
In fourteen years both boys would be a help 
and  later on  Jean Pierre pictured two big sons striding over the land from patch to patch  wringing tribute from the earth beloved and fruitful 
Susan was happy too  for she did not want to be spoken of as the unfortunate woman  and now she had children no one could call her that 
Both herself and her husband had seen something of the larger world 
he during the time of his service 
while she had spent a year or so in Paris with a Breton family 
but had been too home sick to remain longer away from the hilly and green country  set in a barren circle of rocks and sands  where she had been born 
She thought that one of the boys ought perhaps to be a priest  but said nothing to her husband  who was a republican  and hated the 
crows  
as he called the ministers of religion 
The christening was a splendid affair 
All the commune came to it  for the Bacadous were rich and influential  and  now and then  did not mind the expense 
The grandfather had a new coat 
Some months afterwards  one evening when the kitchen had been swept  and the door locked  Jean Pierre  looking at the cot  asked his wife 
 What s the matter with those children 
 And  as if these words  spoken calmly  had been the portent of misfortune  she answered with a loud wail that must have been heard across the yard in the pig sty 
for the pigs 
the Bacadous had the finest pigs in the country 
stirred and grunted complainingly in the night 
The husband went on grinding his bread and butter slowly  gazing at the wall  the soup plate smoking under his chin 
He had returned late from the market  where he had overheard 
not for the first time 
whispers behind his back 
He revolved the words in his mind as he drove back 
 Simple 
Both of them 
 
 
 
Never any use 
 
 
 
Well 
May be  may be 
One must see 
Would ask his wife 
 This was her answer 
He felt like a blow on his chest  but said only 
 Go  draw me some cider 
I am thirsty 
 She went out moaning  an empty jug in her hand 
Then he arose  took up the light  and moved slowly towards the cradle 
They slept 
He looked at them sideways  finished his mouthful there  went back heavily  and sat down before his plate 
When his wife returned he never looked up  but swallowed a couple of spoonfuls noisily  and remarked  in a dull manner 
 
When they sleep they are like other people s children 
 She sat down suddenly on a stool near by  and shook with a silent tempest of sobs  unable to speak 
He finished his meal  and remained idly thrown back in his chair  his eyes lost amongst the black rafters of the ceiling 
Before him the tallow candle flared red and straight  sending up a slender thread of smoke 
The light lay on the rough  sunburnt skin of his throat 
the sunk cheeks were like patches of darkness  and his aspect was mournfully stolid  as if he had ruminated with difficulty endless ideas 
Then he said  deliberately 
 
We must see 
 
 
 consult people 
Don t cry 
 
 
 
They won t all be like that 
 
 
 surely 
We must sleep now 
 After the third child  also a boy  was born  Jean Pierre went about his work with tense hopefulness 
His lips seemed more narrow  more tightly compressed than before 
as if for fear of letting the earth he tilled hear the voice of hope that murmured within his breast 
He watched the child  stepping up to the cot with a heavy clang of sabots on the stone floor  and glanced in  along his shoulder  with that indifference which is like a deformity of peasant humanity 
Like the earth they master and serve  those men  slow of eye and speech  do not show the inner fire 
so that  at last  it becomes a question with them as with the earth  what there is in the core 
heat  violence  a force mysterious and terrible 
or nothing but a clod  a mass fertile and inert  cold and unfeeling  ready to bear a crop of plants that sustain life or give death 
The mother watched with other eyes 
listened with otherwise expectant ears 
Under the high hanging shelves supporting great sides of bacon overhead  her body was busy by the great fireplace  attentive to the pot swinging on iron gallows  scrubbing the long table where the field hands would sit down directly to their evening meal 
Her mind remained by the cradle  night and day on the watch  to hope and suffer 
That child  like the other two  never smiled  never stretched its hands to her  never spoke 
never had a glance of recognition for her in its big black eyes  which could only stare fixedly at any glitter  but failed hopelessly to follow the brilliance of a sun ray slipping slowly along the floor 
When the men were at work she spent long days between her three idiot children and the childish grandfather  who sat grim  angular  and immovable  with his feet near the warm ashes of the fire 
The feeble old fellow seemed to suspect that there was something wrong with his grandsons 
Only once  moved either by affection or by the sense of proprieties  he attempted to nurse the youngest 
He took the boy up from the floor  clicked his tongue at him  and essayed a shaky gallop of his bony knees 
Then he looked closely with his misty eyes at the child s face and deposited him down gently on the floor again 
And he sat  his lean shanks crossed  nodding at the steam escaping from the cooking pot with a gaze senile and worried 
Then mute affliction dwelt in Bacadou s farmhouse  sharing the breath and the bread of its inhabitants 
and the priest of the Ploumar parish had great cause for congratulation 
He called upon the rich landowner  the Marquis de Chavanes  on purpose to deliver himself with joyful unction of solemn platitudes about the inscrutable ways of Providence 
In the vast dimness of the curtained drawing room  the little man  resembling a black bolster  leaned towards a couch  his hat on his knees  and gesticulated with a fat hand at the elongated  gracefully flowing lines of the clear Parisian toilette from which the half amused  half bored marquise listened with gracious languor 
He was exulting and humble  proud and awed 
The impossible had come to pass 
Jean Pierre Bacadou  the enraged republican farmer  had been to mass last Sunday 
had proposed to entertain the visiting priests at the next festival of Ploumar 
It was a triumph for the Church and for the good cause 
 I thought I would come at once to tell Monsieur le Marquis 
I know how anxious he is for the welfare of our country  
declared the priest  wiping his face 
He was asked to stay to dinner 
The Chavanes returning that evening  after seeing their guest to the main gate of the park  discussed the matter while they strolled in the moonlight  trailing their long shadows up the straight avenue of chestnuts 
The marquise  a royalist of course  had been mayor of the commune which includes Ploumar  the scattered hamlets of the coast  and the stony islands that fringe the yellow flatness of the sands 
He had felt his position insecure  for there was a strong republican element in that part of the country 
but now the conversion of Jean Pierre made him safe 
He was very pleased 
 You have no idea how influential those people are  
he explained to his wife 
 Now  I am sure  the next communal election will go all right 
I shall be re 
elected 
 
Your ambition is perfectly insatiable  Charles  
exclaimed the marquise  gaily 
 But  ma chere amie  
argued the husband  seriously  
it s most important that the right man should be mayor this year  because of the elections to the Chamber 
If you think it amuses me 
 
 
 
Jean Pierre had surrendered to his wife s mother 
Madame Levaille was a woman of business  known and respected within a radius of at least fifteen miles 
Thick set and stout  she was seen about the country  on foot or in an acquaintance s cart  perpetually moving  in spite of her fifty eight years  in steady pursuit of business 
She had houses in all the hamlets  she worked quarries of granite  she freighted coasters with stone 
even traded with the Channel Islands 
She was broad cheeked  wide eyed  persuasive in speech 
carrying her point with the placid and invincible obstinacy of an old woman who knows her own mind 
She very seldom slept for two nights together in the same house 
and the wayside inns were the best places to inquire in as to her whereabouts 
She had either passed  or was expected to pass there at six 
or somebody  coming in  had seen her in the morning  or expected to meet her that evening 
After the inns that command the roads  the churches were the buildings she frequented most 
Men of liberal opinions would induce small children to run into sacred edifices to see whether Madame Levaille was there  and to tell her that so and so was in the road waiting to speak to her about potatoes  or flour  or stones  or houses 
and she would curtail her devotions  come out blinking and crossing herself into the sunshine 
ready to discuss business matters in a calm  sensible way across a table in the kitchen of the inn opposite 
Latterly she had stayed for a few days several times with her son in law  arguing against sorrow and misfortune with composed face and gentle tones 
Jean Pierre felt the convictions imbibed in the regiment torn out of his breast 
not by arguments but by facts 
Striding over his fields he thought it over 
There were three of them 
Three 
All alike 
Why 
Such things did not happen to everybody 
to nobody he ever heard of 
One 
might pass 
But three 
All three 
Forever useless  to be fed while he lived and 
 
 
 What would become of the land when he died 
This must be seen to 
He would sacrifice his convictions 
One day he told his wife 
 
See what your God will do for us 
Pay for some masses 
 Susan embraced her man 
He stood unbending  then turned on his heels and went out 
But afterwards  when a black soutane darkened his doorway  he did not object 
even offered some cider himself to the priest 
He listened to the talk meekly 
went to mass between the two women 
accomplished what the priest called 
his religious duties 
at Easter 
That morning he felt like a man who had sold his soul 
In the afternoon he fought ferociously with an old friend and neighbour who had remarked that the priests had the best of it and were now going to eat the priest eater 
He came home dishevelled and bleeding  and happening to catch sight of his children 
they were kept generally out of the way   cursed and swore incoherently  banging the table 
Susan wept 
Madame Levaille sat serenely unmoved 
She assured her daughter that 
It will pass 
 and taking up her thick umbrella  departed in haste to see after a schooner she was going to load with granite from her quarry 
A year or so afterwards the girl was born 
A girl 
Jean Pierre heard of it in the fields  and was so upset by the news that he sat down on the boundary wall and remained there till the evening  instead of going home as he was urged to do 
A girl 
He felt half cheated 
However  when he got home he was partly reconciled to his fate 
One could marry her to a good fellow 
not to a good for nothing  but to a fellow with some understanding and a good pair of arms 
Besides  the next may be a boy  he thought 
Of course they would be all right 
His new credulity knew of no doubt 
The ill luck was broken 
He spoke cheerily to his wife 
She was also hopeful 
Three priests came to that christening  and Madame Levaille was godmother 
The child turned out an idiot too 
Then on market days Jean Pierre was seen bargaining bitterly  quarrelsome and greedy 
then getting drunk with taciturn earnestness 
then driving home in the dusk at a rate fit for a wedding  but with a face gloomy enough for a funeral 
Sometimes he would insist on his wife coming with him 
and they would drive in the early morning  shaking side by side on the narrow seat above the helpless pig  that  with tied legs  grunted a melancholy sigh at every rut 
The morning drives were silent 
but in the evening  coming home  Jean Pierre  tipsy  was viciously muttering  and growled at the confounded woman who could not rear children that were like anybody else s 
Susan  holding on against the erratic swayings of the cart  pretended not to hear 
Once  as they were driving through Ploumar  some obscure and drunken impulse caused him to pull up sharply opposite the church 
The moon swam amongst light white clouds 
The tombstones gleamed pale under the fretted shadows of the trees in the churchyard 
Even the village dogs slept 
Only the nightingales  awake  spun out the thrill of their song above the silence of graves 
Jean Pierre said thickly to his wife 
 
What do you think is there 
 He pointed his whip at the tower 
in which the big dial of the clock appeared high in the moonlight like a pallid face without eyes 
and getting out carefully  fell down at once by the wheel 
He picked himself up and climbed one by one the few steps to the iron gate of the churchyard 
He put his face to the bars and called out indistinctly 
 
Hey there 
Come out 
 
Jean 
Return 
Return 
 entreated his wife in low tones 
He took no notice  and seemed to wait there 
The song of nightingales beat on all sides against the high walls of the church  and flowed back between stone crosses and flat gray slabs  engraved with words of hope and sorrow 
 Hey 
Come out 
 shouted Jean Pierre  loudly 
The nightingales ceased to sing 
 Nobody 
 went on Jean Pierre 
 Nobody there 
A swindle of the crows 
That s what this is 
Nobody anywhere 
I despise it 
Allez 
Houp 
 He shook the gate with all his strength  and the iron bars rattled with a frightful clanging  like a chain dragged over stone steps 
A dog near by barked hurriedly 
Jean Pierre staggered back  and after three successive dashes got into his cart 
Susan sat very quiet and still 
He said to her with drunken severity 
 
See 
Nobody 
I ve been made a fool 
Malheur 
Somebody will pay for it 
The next one I see near the house I will lay my whip on 
 
 
 on the black spine 
 
 
 I will 
I don t want him in there 
 
 
 he only helps the carrion crows to rob poor folk 
I am a man 
 
 
 
We will see if I can t have children like anybody else 
 
 
 now you mind 
 
 
 
They won t be all 
 
 
 all 
 
 
 we see 
 
 
 
 She burst out through the fingers that hid her face 
 
Don t say that  Jean 
don t say that  my man 
 He struck her a swinging blow on the head with the back of his hand and knocked her into the bottom of the cart  where she crouched  thrown about lamentably by every jolt 
He drove furiously  standing up  brandishing his whip  shaking the reins over the gray horse that galloped ponderously  making the heavy harness leap upon his broad quarters 
The country rang clamorous in the night with the irritated barking of farm dogs  that followed the rattle of wheels all along the road 
A couple of belated wayfarers had only just time to step into the ditch 
At his own gate he caught the post and was shot out of the cart head first 
The horse went on slowly to the door 
At Susan s piercing cries the farm hands rushed out 
She thought him dead  but he was only sleeping where he fell  and cursed his men  who hastened to him  for disturbing his slumbers 
Autumn came 
The clouded sky descended low upon the black contours of the hills 
and the dead leaves danced in spiral whirls under naked trees  till the wind  sighing profoundly  laid them to rest in the hollows of bare valleys 
And from morning till night one could see all over the land black denuded boughs  the boughs gnarled and twisted  as if contorted with pain  swaying sadly between the wet clouds and the soaked earth 
The clear and gentle streams of summer days rushed discoloured and raging at the stones that barred the way to the sea  with the fury of madness bent upon suicide 
From horizon to horizon the great road to the sands lay between the hills in a dull glitter of empty curves  resembling an unnavigable river of mud 
Jean Pierre went from field to field  moving blurred and tall in the drizzle  or striding on the crests of rises  lonely and high upon the gray curtain of drifting clouds  as if he had been pacing along the very edge of the universe 
He looked at the black earth  at the earth mute and promising  at the mysterious earth doing its work of life in death like stillness under the veiled sorrow of the sky 
And it seemed to him that to a man worse than childless there was no promise in the fertility of fields  that from him the earth escaped  defied him  frowned at him like the clouds  sombre and hurried above his head 
Having to face alone his own fields  he felt the inferiority of man who passes away before the clod that remains 
Must he give up the hope of having by his side a son who would look at the turned up sods with a master s eye 
A man that would think as he thought  that would feel as he felt 
a man who would be part of himself  and yet remain to trample masterfully on that earth when he was gone 
He thought of some distant relations  and felt savage enough to curse them aloud 
They 
Never 
He turned homewards  going straight at the roof of his dwelling  visible between the enlaced skeletons of trees 
As he swung his legs over the stile a cawing flock of birds settled slowly on the field 
dropped down behind his back  noiseless and fluttering  like flakes of soot 
That day Madame Levaille had gone early in the afternoon to the house she had near Kervanion 
She had to pay some of the men who worked in her granite quarry there  and she went in good time because her little house contained a shop where the workmen could spend their wages without the trouble of going to town 
The house stood alone amongst rocks 
A lane of mud and stones ended at the door 
The sea winds coming ashore on Stonecutter s point  fresh from the fierce turmoil of the waves  howled violently at the unmoved heaps of black boulders holding up steadily short armed  high crosses against the tremendous rush of the invisible 
In the sweep of gales the sheltered dwelling stood in a calm resonant and disquieting  like the calm in the centre of a hurricane 
On stormy nights  when the tide was out  the bay of Fougere  fifty feet below the house  resembled an immense black pit  from which ascended mutterings and sighs as if the sands down there had been alive and complaining 
At high tide the returning water assaulted the ledges of rock in short rushes  ending in bursts of livid light and columns of spray  that flew inland  stinging to death the grass of pastures 
The darkness came from the hills  flowed over the coast  put out the red fires of sunset  and went on to seaward pursuing the retiring tide 
The wind dropped with the sun  leaving a maddened sea and a devastated sky 
The heavens above the house seemed to be draped in black rags  held up here and there by pins of fire 
Madame Levaille  for this evening the servant of her own workmen  tried to induce them to depart 
 An old woman like me ought to be in bed at this late hour  
she good humouredly repeated 
The quarrymen drank  asked for more 
They shouted over the table as if they had been talking across a field 
At one end four of them played cards  banging the wood with their hard knuckles  and swearing at every lead 
One sat with a lost gaze  humming a bar of some song  which he repeated endlessly 
Two others  in a corner  were quarrelling confidentially and fiercely over some woman  looking close into one another s eyes as if they had wanted to tear them out  but speaking in whispers that promised violence and murder discreetly  in a venomous sibillation of subdued words 
The atmosphere in there was thick enough to slice with a knife 
Three candles burning about the long room glowed red and dull like sparks expiring in ashes 
The slight click of the iron latch was at that late hour as unexpected and startling as a thunder clap 
Madame Levaille put down a bottle she held above a liqueur glass 
the players turned their heads 
the whispered quarrel ceased 
only the singer  after darting a glance at the door  went on humming with a stolid face 
Susan appeared in the doorway  stepped in  flung the door to  and put her back against it  saying  half aloud 
 
Mother 
 Madame Levaille  taking up the bottle again  said calmly 
 Here you are  my girl 
What a state you are in 
 The neck of the bottle rang on the rim of the glass  for the old woman was startled  and the idea that the farm had caught fire had entered her head 
She could think of no other cause for her daughter s appearance 
Susan  soaked and muddy  stared the whole length of the room towards the men at the far end 
Her mother asked 
 
What has happened 
God guard us from misfortune 
 Susan moved her lips 
No sound came 
Madame Levaille stepped up to her daughter  took her by the arm  looked into her face 
 In God s name  
she said  shakily  
what s the matter 
You have been rolling in mud 
 
 
 
Why did you come 
 
 
 
Where s Jean 
 The men had all got up and approached slowly  staring with dull surprise 
Madame Levaille jerked her daughter away from the door  swung her round upon a seat close to the wall 
Then she turned fiercely to the men 
 
Enough of this 
Out you go 
you others 
I close 
 One of them observed  looking down at Susan collapsed on the seat 
 She is 
one may say 
half dead 
 Madame Levaille flung the door open 
 Get out 
March 
 she cried  shaking nervously 
They dropped out into the night  laughing stupidly 
Outside  the two Lotharios broke out into loud shouts 
The others tried to soothe them  all talking at once 
The noise went away up the lane with the men  who staggered together in a tight knot  remonstrating with one another foolishly 
 Speak  Susan 
What is it 
Speak 
 entreated Madame Levaille  as soon as the door was shut 
Susan pronounced some incomprehensible words  glaring at the table 
The old woman clapped her hands above her head  let them drop  and stood looking at her daughter with disconsolate eyes 
Her husband had been 
deranged in his head 
for a few years before he died  and now she began to suspect her daughter was going mad 
She asked  pressingly 
 
Does Jean know where you are 
Where is Jean 
 
He knows 
 
 
 he is dead 
 
What 
 cried the old woman 
She came up near  and peering at her daughter  repeated three times 
 What do you say 
What do you say 
What do you say 
 Susan sat dry eyed and stony before Madame Levaille  who contemplated her  feeling a strange sense of inexplicable horror creep into the silence of the house 
She had hardly realised the news  further than to understand that she had been brought in one short moment face to face with something unexpected and final 
It did not even occur to her to ask for any explanation 
She thought 
accident 
terrible accident 
blood to the head 
fell down a trap door in the loft 
 
 
 
She remained there  distracted and mute  blinking her old eyes 
Suddenly  Susan said 
 
I have killed him 
 For a moment the mother stood still  almost unbreathing  but with composed face 
The next second she burst out into a shout 
 
You miserable madwoman 
 
 
 they will cut your neck 
 
 
 
 She fancied the gendarmes entering the house  saying to her 
 We want your daughter 
give her up 
 the gendarmes with the severe  hard faces of men on duty 
She knew the brigadier well 
an old friend  familiar and respectful  saying heartily  
To your good health  Madame 
 before lifting to his lips the small glass of cognac 
out of the special bottle she kept for friends 
And now 
 
 
 
She was losing her head 
She rushed here and there  as if looking for something urgently needed 
gave that up  stood stock still in the middle of the room  and screamed at her daughter 
 
Why 
Say 
Say 
Why 
 The other seemed to leap out of her strange apathy 
 Do you think I am made of stone 
 she shouted back  striding towards her mother 
 No 
It s impossible 
 
 
 
 said Madame Levaille  in a convinced tone 
 You go and see  mother  
retorted Susan  looking at her with blazing eyes 
 There s no money in heaven 
no justice 
No 
 
 
 
I did not know 
 
 
 
Do you think I have no heart 
Do you think I have never heard people jeering at me  pitying me  wondering at me 
Do you know how some of them were calling me 
The mother of idiots 
that was my nickname 
And my children never would know me  never speak to me 
They would know nothing 
neither men 
nor God 
Haven t I prayed 
But the Mother of God herself would not hear me 
A mother 
 
 
 
Who is accursed 
I  or the man who is dead 
Eh 
Tell me 
I took care of myself 
Do you think I would defy the anger of God and have my house full of those things 
that are worse than animals who know the hand that feeds them 
Who blasphemed in the night at the very church door 
Was it I 
 
 
 
I only wept and prayed for mercy 
 
 
 and I feel the curse at every moment of the day 
I see it round me from morning to night 
 
 
 I ve got to keep them alive 
to take care of my misfortune and shame 
And he would come 
I begged him and Heaven for mercy 
 
 
 
No 
 
 
 
Then we shall see 
 
 
 
He came this evening 
I thought to myself 
 Ah 
again 
 
 
 
 I had my long scissors 
I heard him shouting 
 
 
 I saw him near 
 
 
 
I must 
must I 
 
 
 
Then take 
 
 
 
And I struck him in the throat above the breastbone 
 
 
 
I never heard him even sigh 
 
 
 
I left him standing 
 
 
 
It was a minute ago 
How did I come here 
 Madame Levaille shivered 
A wave of cold ran down her back  down her fat arms under her tight sleeves  made her stamp gently where she stood 
Quivers ran over the broad cheeks  across the thin lips  ran amongst the wrinkles at the corners of her steady old eyes 
She stammered 
 
You wicked woman 
you disgrace me 
But there 
You always resembled your father 
What do you think will become of you 
 
 
 in the other world 
In this 
 
 
 Oh misery 
 She was very hot now 
She felt burning inside 
She wrung her perspiring hands 
and suddenly  starting in great haste  began to look for her big shawl and umbrella  feverishly  never once glancing at her daughter  who stood in the middle of the room following her with a gaze distracted and cold 
 Nothing worse than in this  
said Susan 
Her mother  umbrella in hand and trailing the shawl over the floor  groaned profoundly 
 I must go to the priest  
she burst out passionately 
 I do not know whether you even speak the truth 
You are a horrible woman 
They will find you anywhere 
You may stay here 
or go 
There is no room for you in this world 
 Ready now to depart  she yet wandered aimlessly about the room  putting the bottles on the shelf  trying to fit with trembling hands the covers on cardboard boxes 
Whenever the real sense of what she had heard emerged for a second from the haze of her thoughts she would fancy that something had exploded in her brain without  unfortunately  bursting her head to pieces 
which would have been a relief 
She blew the candles out one by one without knowing it  and was horribly startled by the darkness 
She fell on a bench and began to whimper 
After a while she ceased  and sat listening to the breathing of her daughter  whom she could hardly see  still and upright  giving no other sign of life 
She was becoming old rapidly at last  during those minutes 
She spoke in tones unsteady  cut about by the rattle of teeth  like one shaken by a deadly cold fit of ague 
 I wish you had died little 
I will never dare to show my old head in the sunshine again 
There are worse misfortunes than idiot children 
I wish you had been born to me simple 
like your own 
 
 
 
 She saw the figure of her daughter pass before the faint and livid clearness of a window 
Then it appeared in the doorway for a second  and the door swung to with a clang 
Madame Levaille  as if awakened by the noise from a long nightmare  rushed out 
 Susan 
 she shouted from the doorstep 
She heard a stone roll a long time down the declivity of the rocky beach above the sands 
She stepped forward cautiously  one hand on the wall of the house  and peered down into the smooth darkness of the empty bay 
Once again she cried 
 
Susan 
You will kill yourself there 
 The stone had taken its last leap in the dark  and she heard nothing now 
A sudden thought seemed to strangle her  and she called no more 
She turned her back upon the black silence of the pit and went up the lane towards Ploumar  stumbling along with sombre determination  as if she had started on a desperate journey that would last  perhaps  to the end of her life 
A sullen and periodic clamour of waves rolling over reefs followed her far inland between the high hedges sheltering the gloomy solitude of the fields 
Susan had run out  swerving sharp to the left at the door  and on the edge of the slope crouched down behind a boulder 
A dislodged stone went on downwards  rattling as it leaped 
When Madame Levaille called out  Susan could have  by stretching her hand  touched her mother s skirt  had she had the courage to move a limb 
She saw the old woman go away  and she remained still  closing her eyes and pressing her side to the hard and rugged surface of the rock 
After a while a familiar face with fixed eyes and an open mouth became visible in the intense obscurity amongst the boulders 
She uttered a low cry and stood up 
The face vanished  leaving her to gasp and shiver alone in the wilderness of stone heaps 
But as soon as she had crouched down again to rest  with her head against the rock  the face returned  came very near  appeared eager to finish the speech that had been cut short by death  only a moment ago 
She scrambled quickly to her feet and said 
 Go away  or I will do it again 
 The thing wavered  swung to the right  to the left 
She moved this way and that  stepped back  fancied herself screaming at it  and was appalled by the unbroken stillness of the night 
She tottered on the brink  felt the steep declivity under her feet  and rushed down blindly to save herself from a headlong fall 
The shingle seemed to wake up 
the pebbles began to roll before her  pursued her from above  raced down with her on both sides  rolling past with an increasing clatter 
In the peace of the night the noise grew  deepening to a rumour  continuous and violent  as if the whole semicircle of the stony beach had started to tumble down into the bay 
Susan s feet hardly touched the slope that seemed to run down with her 
At the bottom she stumbled  shot forward  throwing her arms out  and fell heavily 
She jumped up at once and turned swiftly to look back  her clenched hands full of sand she had clutched in her fall 
The face was there  keeping its distance  visible in its own sheen that made a pale stain in the night 
She shouted  
Go away 
 
she shouted at it with pain  with fear  with all the rage of that useless stab that could not keep him quiet  keep him out of her sight 
What did he want now 
He was dead 
Dead men have no children 
Would he never leave her alone 
She shrieked at it 
waved her outstretched hands 
She seemed to feel the breath of parted lips  and  with a long cry of discouragement  fled across the level bottom of the bay 
She ran lightly  unaware of any effort of her body 
High sharp rocks that  when the bay is full  show above the glittering plain of blue water like pointed towers of submerged churches  glided past her  rushing to the land at a tremendous pace 
To the left  in the distance  she could see something shining 
a broad disc of light in which narrow shadows pivoted round the centre like the spokes of a wheel 
She heard a voice calling  
Hey 
There 
 and answered with a wild scream 
So  he could call yet 
He was calling after her to stop 
Never 
 
 
 
She tore through the night  past the startled group of seaweed gatherers who stood round their lantern paralysed with fear at the unearthly screech coming from that fleeing shadow 
The men leaned on their pitchforks staring fearfully 
A woman fell on her knees  and  crossing herself  began to pray aloud 
A little girl with her ragged skirt full of slimy seaweed began to sob despairingly  lugging her soaked burden close to the man who carried the light 
Somebody said 
 The thing ran out towards the sea 
 Another voice exclaimed 
 And the sea is coming back 
Look at the spreading puddles 
Do you hear 
you woman 
there 
Get up 
 Several voices cried together 
 Yes  let us be off 
Let the accursed thing go to the sea 
 They moved on  keeping close round the light 
Suddenly a man swore loudly 
He would go and see what was the matter 
It had been a woman s voice 
He would go 
There were shrill protests from women 
but his high form detached itself from the group and went off running 
They sent an unanimous call of scared voices after him 
A word  insulting and mocking  came back  thrown at them through the darkness 
A woman moaned 
An old man said gravely 
 Such things ought to be left alone 
 They went on slower  shuffling in the yielding sand and whispering to one another that Millot feared nothing  having no religion  but that it would end badly some day 
Susan met the incoming tide by the Raven islet and stopped  panting  with her feet in the water 
She heard the murmur and felt the cold caress of the sea  and  calmer now  could see the sombre and confused mass of the Raven on one side and on the other the long white streak of Molene sands that are left high above the dry bottom of Fougere Bay at every ebb 
She turned round and saw far away  along the starred background of the sky  the ragged outline of the coast 
Above it  nearly facing her  appeared the tower of Ploumar Church 
a slender and tall pyramid shooting up dark and pointed into the clustered glitter of the stars 
She felt strangely calm 
She knew where she was  and began to remember how she came there 
and why 
She peered into the smooth obscurity near her 
She was alone 
There was nothing there 
nothing near her  either living or dead 
The tide was creeping in quietly  putting out long impatient arms of strange rivulets that ran towards the land between ridges of sand 
Under the night the pools grew bigger with mysterious rapidity  while the great sea  yet far off  thundered in a regular rhythm along the indistinct line of the horizon 
Susan splashed her way back for a few yards without being able to get clear of the water that murmured tenderly all around and  suddenly  with a spiteful gurgle  nearly took her off her feet 
Her heart thumped with fear 
This place was too big and too empty to die in 
To morrow they would do with her what they liked 
But before she died she must tell them 
tell the gentlemen in black clothes that there are things no woman can bear 
She must explain how it happened 
 
 
 
She splashed through a pool  getting wet to the waist  too preoccupied to care 
 
 
 
She must explain 
 He came in the same way as ever and said  just so 
 Do you think I am going to leave the land to those people from Morbihan that I do not know 
Do you 
We shall see 
Come along  you creature of mischance 
 And he put his arms out 
Then  Messieurs  I said 
 Before God 
never 
 And he said  striding at me with open palms 
 There is no God to hold me 
Do you understand  you useless carcase 
I will do what I like 
 And he took me by the shoulders 
Then I  Messieurs  called to God for help  and next minute  while he was shaking me  I felt my long scissors in my hand 
His shirt was unbuttoned  and  by the candle 
light  I saw the hollow of his throat 
I cried 
 Let go 
 He was crushing my shoulders 
He was strong  my man was 
Then I thought 
No 
 
 
 
Must I 
 
 
 
Then take 
 and I struck in the hollow place 
I never saw him fall 
 
 
 
The old father never turned his head 
He is deaf and childish  gentlemen 
 
 
 
Nobody saw him fall 
I ran out 
 
 
 Nobody saw 
 
 
 
 She had been scrambling amongst the boulders of the Raven and now found herself  all out of breath  standing amongst the heavy shadows of the rocky islet 
The Raven is connected with the main land by a natural pier of immense and slippery stones 
She intended to return home that way 
Was he still standing there 
At home 
Home 
Four idiots and a corpse 
She must go back and explain 
Anybody would understand 
 
 
 
Below her the night or the sea seemed to pronounce distinctly 
 
Aha 
I see you at last 
 She started  slipped  fell 
and without attempting to rise  listened  terrified 
She heard heavy breathing  a clatter of wooden clogs 
It stopped 
 Where the devil did you pass 
 said an invisible man  hoarsely 
She held her breath 
She recognized the voice 
She had not seen him fall 
Was he pursuing her there dead  or perhaps 
 
 
 alive 
She lost her head 
She cried from the crevice where she lay huddled  
Never  never 
 
Ah 
You are still there 
You led me a fine dance 
Wait  my beauty  I must see how you look after all this 
You wait 
 
 
 
 Millot was stumbling  laughing  swearing meaninglessly out of pure satisfaction  pleased with himself for having run down that fly by night 
 As if there were such things as ghosts 
Bah 
It took an old African soldier to show those clodhoppers 
 
 
 
But it was curious 
Who the devil was she 
 Susan listened  crouching 
He was coming for her  this dead man 
There was no escape 
What a noise he made amongst the stones 
 
 
 
She saw his head rise up  then the shoulders 
He was tall 
her own man 
His long arms waved about  and it was his own voice sounding a little strange 
 
 
 because of the scissors 
She scrambled out quickly  rushed to the edge of the causeway  and turned round 
The man stood still on a high stone  detaching himself in dead black on the glitter of the sky 
 Where are you going to 
 he called  roughly 
She answered  
Home 
 and watched him intensely 
He made a striding  clumsy leap on to another boulder  and stopped again  balancing himself  then said 
 
Ha 
ha 
Well  I am going with you 
It s the least I can do 
Ha 
ha 
ha 
 She stared at him till her eyes seemed to become glowing coals that burned deep into her brain  and yet she was in mortal fear of making out the well known features 
Below her the sea lapped softly against the rock with a splash continuous and gentle 
The man said  advancing another step 
 
I am coming for you 
What do you think 
 She trembled 
Coming for her 
There was no escape  no peace  no hope 
She looked round despairingly 
Suddenly the whole shadowy coast  the blurred islets  the heaven itself  swayed about twice  then came to a rest 
She closed her eyes and shouted 
 
Can t you wait till I am dead 
 She was shaken by a furious hate for that shade that pursued her in this world  unappeased even by death in its longing for an heir that would be like other people s children 
 Hey 
What 
 said Millot  keeping his distance prudently 
He was saying to himself 
 Look out 
Some lunatic 
An accident happens soon 
 She went on  wildly 
 
I want to live 
To live alone 
for a week 
for a day 
I must explain to them 
 
 
 
I would tear you to pieces  I would kill you twenty times over rather than let you touch me while I live 
How many times must I kill you 
you blasphemer 
Satan sends you here 
I am damned too 
 
Come  
said Millot  alarmed and conciliating 
 I am perfectly alive 
 
 
 
Oh  my God 
 She had screamed  
Alive 
 and at once vanished before his eyes  as if the islet itself had swerved aside from under her feet 
Millot rushed forward  and fell flat with his chin over the edge 
Far below he saw the water whitened by her struggles  and heard one shrill cry for help that seemed to dart upwards along the perpendicular face of the rock  and soar past  straight into the high and impassive heaven 
Madame Levaille sat  dry eyed  on the short grass of the hill side  with her thick legs stretched out  and her old feet turned up in their black cloth shoes 
Her clogs stood near by  and further off the umbrella lay on the withered sward like a weapon dropped from the grasp of a vanquished warrior 
The Marquis of Chavanes  on horseback  one gloved hand on thigh  looked down at her as she got up laboriously  with groans 
On the narrow track of the seaweed carts four men were carrying inland Susan s body on a hand barrow  while several others straggled listlessly behind 
Madame Levaille looked after the procession 
 Yes  Monsieur le Marquis  
she said dispassionately  in her usual calm tone of a reasonable old woman 
 There are unfortunate people on this earth 
I had only one child 
Only one 
And they won t bury her in consecrated ground 
 Her eyes filled suddenly  and a short shower of tears rolled down the broad cheeks 
She pulled the shawl close about her 
The Marquis leaned slightly over in his saddle  and said 
 
It is very sad 
You have all my sympathy 
I shall speak to the Cure 
She was unquestionably insane  and the fall was accidental 
Millot says so distinctly 
Good day  Madame 
 And he trotted off  thinking to himself 
 I must get this old woman appointed guardian of those idiots  and administrator of the farm 
It would be much better than having here one of those other Bacadous  probably a red republican  corrupting my commune
